## What this is all about  
> This is a simple TPS game project. We focus primarily on the server-side programming for we both are interested in network programming.
We are going to use C# for the client programming with Unity and C++ for the socket programming with VS.

## Things to be done
> ### Client
>> - Getting familliar with the features that Unity Editor provides for us
>> - Write codes for connecting to the main server
>> - If the connection is established successfully, then a user can see the lobby.
>> - A user can enter a room with double-clicking one of the rooms shown on the list.
>> - A room can accommodate up to 16 users ( 8 on the left team, 8 on the right team )  
> ### Server
>> - Write codes for handling connection requests from clients.
>> - Self-study on IOCP and various concepts used for windows socket programming.
